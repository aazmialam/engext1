            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-4"><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Friday 26th August 2016</span><br></p><p>Marylebone, London</p><p><br></p><p>The wind slapped my face as I turned the corner into Baker Street, its flagstones shining, illuminated in the winter moonlight. I quickened my pace towards the blackened buildings which were sandwiched between each other at the northern end of the street, my iPhone 6S Plus bouncing around in my jacket pocket. I stopped in my tracks as Google Maps’ voice told me ‘You have arrived” in a muffled voice from my jacket, and I glanced up to see 221B embossed in gold on the front door of the house. I rang the bell. No response. I was unsure about whether to endure the howling of the wind any longer. I glanced at my watch, it had been a minute, and it wouldn’t be likely that Holmes would be up now – a great mind, needs a good night’s rest. As I turned around, I heard a doorknob click into motion. A kindly face peered at me from the illuminated doorway, which I was later to learn was that of Mr Holmes’ associate, Dr.Watson.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can I be of assistance?” he said.</p><p><br></p><p>I rushed to explain my presence on this blustery winter’s night. “I am Austin Sutherland, my sister Mary Sutherland has been murdered, and the police have been unable to identify the murderer, I need to consult Mr Sherlock Holmes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“He is still available, come in please.”</p><p><br></p><p>Dr Watson led me to what seemed to be an office. Paper stacks toppled over one another and hid the computer and printer. A lot cleaner than what I had thought. I waited patiently in the doorway, and a man standing at the window smoking a vaper, his back turned to me, looking down onto the porch and street below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>“Mr Sutherland, you have come to see me about your sister’s unexplained death. Please make yourself comfortable.”</p><p><br></p><p>He pointed towards a couch overflowing with papers and documented files which were piled up in front of a muted 50 inch Samsung TV tuned to SBS, obscuring half the picture.</p><p><br></p><p>I hastily began my explanation, not wishing to take up any more of the great man’s time than was necessary. “I come to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easily when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. I wish you would do as much for me. I am willing to give you whatever I have to know what has become of my sister, Mary Sutherland and her husband, Mr. Hosmer Angel.”</p><p><br></p><p>“They had only been married for six months. Last week on Monday on the 15th of August, I called Mary, but she hadn’t picked up. I tried to contact both Hosmer and Mary but got no response at all. I decided to drive to their house, but they weren’t at home. I drove past the railway station opposite their street to find their car parked at the station parking. The platforms were quiet and bare. There was only one isolated train compartment that was left on the side of the platform for repair. As I walked around it, calling out her name, I found the body of my dear sister Mary. She was only 24. She had her whole life ahead of her. And there I found her on the platform, stone cold dead.”</p><p><br></p><p>My face started to heat up as a tear escaped and streamed its way down my cheek.</p><p><br></p><p>“What about Hosmer, did you find him around anywhere?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, I didn’t bother looking, as soon as I saw Mary I called for 999.”</p><p><br></p><p>“How did Hosmer and Mary meet?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was all very quick. Mary had been actively experimenting with online dating sites, and happened to find Hosmer. Things worked quite well and quickly, which lead them on to getting married, which was happily taken by my family. Everyone loved him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And no news of Hosmer since Mary’s death?”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, he hasn’t replied to my texts and doesn’t pick up his phone. He isn’t at home either.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Would you please be able to give me Mary’s phone, Hosmer’s number and their address?”</p><p><br></p><p>I handed him a paper with all the details.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t worry about Mr Angel. I’m afraid he won’t be coming back.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why not?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Leave that with me. I know it is hard, but let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life. You should continue to focus on yourself. We will get back to you as soon as we can.”</p><p><br></p><p>***</p><p><br></p><p>Mary had spent her life after her father’s premature death when she was five, living with her mother and step-father, James Windibank, a man who seemed somewhat cold and removed. He was always busy with his business interests, had little to say to her. However, at such a young and impressionable age, this was something she simply accepted as normal.</p><p><br></p><p>Seven months prior to her untimely death, Mary had been online searching for a suitable husband. She was known to have been the inheritor of a sizeable estate after her mother’s death, an issue that had caused considerable disagreement with her step-father and was wary of revealing any details about herself that might give this information away. That evening she had started chatting with a guy who had seemed nice. They shared the same interests and read the same authors. They met up at a bar a few days later, and then continued to meet for the next few weeks. Although it always seemed strange to Mary that Hosmer had always refused to take his hat or glasses off, she had fallen in love with Hosmer, and it seemed natural that barely a few weeks after they had met, he had proposed to her.</p><p><br></p><p>***</p><p><br></p><p>“WATSON! WATSON!”</p><p><br></p><p>Watson limped as fast as he could to Holmes’ room to find Holmes’ eyes fixated on his laptop.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Holmes? Have you got a lead?”</p><p><br></p><p>“It was barely a challenge. Mary didn’t marry Hosmer. Hosmer didn’t exist. She married James Windibank -  a renowned conman, who was known to police, but who had always evaded their clutches.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Do you know how he looks?”</p><p><br></p><p>“I checked the CCTV camera footage at the station, it is definitely him. He only stayed married to her for six months to ensure that he would be able to pocket Mary’s life insurance money. The money must have already been transferred into his account. The funniest part is that he was lawfully Miss Sutherland’s step-father! I must say that his profile picture set on the site they had ‘met’ was strategically crafted. I have detected his mobile phone location so we need to get to him now. I’m getting the car, hurry along now. Call the police too, we will need some help.”</p><p><br></p><p>Watson quickly made his way out of the house to the front porch to meet Holmes, already in the car. They drove down the narrow brick paved roads of Marylebone until they arrived at an isolated warehouse, where crates were sandwiched between one another. Holmes got out of the car and spotted the unmarked police car immediately from the other parked cars. He bid them to stay inside their vehicles and await his instructions.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Holmes’ voice boomed through the hollow room.</p><p><br></p><p>“MR JAMES WINDIBANK! I know you are here and are responsible for the death of Mary Sutherland, show yourself now. It is pointless for you to resist arrest.”</p><p><br></p><p>From behind a parked truck, a tall sturdy man with a cold look in his grey eyes emerged. His hands gripped a knife which was broken from the top but line with evil-looking serrations all the way down.</p><p><br></p><p>Holmes lifted his hand, and upon his request, the police emerged from their car and stealthily moved forward into the building. Watson remained in the car, with his nose pressed against the tinted window.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Windibank sauntered around and behind the truck.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>“This is the usual drill, isn’t it?” said Windibank with a sneer in his voice. “Come on copper, come and arrest me.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Stand still and drop the knife and any other armed weapons or else we will fire. Mr James Windibank, you are officially under arrest for the murder of Miss Mary Sutherland.”</p><p><br></p><p>Windibank froze, and the police advanced quickly towards him, who simply chuckled as he was grappled to the ground, and then bundled into a waiting van.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well that went better than expected,” exclaimed Holmes as he opened the car door to see Watson cowering behind the steering wheel.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes Holmes,” said Watson, his teeth chattering, “Well played I must say.”</p><p><br></p><p>“A bit more of a challenge is what I really need though, Watson.”</p><p><br></p><p>“I’m sure there are more cases waiting just for you, Sherlock.”</p><p><br></p><p>***</p><p><br></p><p>Monday 18th October 2016</p><p>Marylebone, London</p><p><br></p><p>“WATSON! WATSON!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Sherlock I’m coming.”</p><p><br></p><p>Watson paced his way across the kitchen and into the lounge room. Sherlock handed him the London Evening Standard. Watson read the headline aloud,</p><p><br></p><p>“Convicted murderer, James Windibank, on the run after HMP Pentonville prison escape.”</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p></div>
