            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-4"><p>A Case of Identity&nbsp;is based on the story of a young woman, Miss Mary Sutherland. Mary Sutherland has brought Holmes a problem of the disappearing fiancé.</p><p></p><div>Mary Sutherland is a young woman who has an income by working as a typist and receives an inherited payment from the business left to her by her father. Miss Sutherland gives all of her income to her mother and stepfather, James Windibank, as she lives at home.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>James Windibank had been reluctant to allow Mary to mix with people outside of her family circle, until only recently. This allowed her to finally have an opportunity to find a man that she would be willing to marry. This situation had changed when Mary Sutherland had attended the Gasfitter’s Ball when her stepfather had been on a. business trip outside the country. At the Ball, Mary had met a young man called Hosmer Angel, who she started to see.</div><div><br></div><div>Mary Sutherland is in love with Hosmer Angel, but she knows little about him. She describes him as a mysterious quiet man. Hosmer Angel agrees to only meet with Mary when dusk has fallen, he has long whiskers and wears tinted glasses. He communicates with Mary through typewritten letters, and Mary posts her letters back to a Post Office address, rather to Angel’s address, as she does not know where he lives, or works.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Eventually, Mary had told her stepfather about her relationship with Hosmer Angel, despite her initially fear that James Windibank will be angry. However, her stepfather is in favour of the relationship and allow for their marriage. On the day of the wedding, Hosmer Angel enters a Hansom cab, but when the cab arrives to the church, Angel was not found inside.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Holmes has solved the case before Mary has even finished her story. He advises Mary to forget about her fiancé. However, she will not do this and intends to be loyal to him, as promised, for ten years at least. Holmes decides to bring the case to a conclusion by writing a note to James Windibank asking him to come to Baker Street.</div><div><br></div><div>Holmes explains the case and identifies James Windibank and Hosmer Angel to be the same person. The description of Hosmer Angel is that of a man in disguise. This is justified by Hosmer Angel only being around when Windibank is absent. He also highlights that Windibank has a financial motive for keeping Mary Sutherland at home. Hosmer Angel had escaped on the wedding day by exiting from the opposite door of the Hansom Cab to the one he entered, after which he removed his disguise.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The deducted proof to Holmes’ supposition is confirmed when James Windibank sends a typewritten letter to Holmes, accepting his invitation. Holmes compares this note to the one written from Hosmer Angel to Mary and is sure that they were typed on the same machine.</div><div>When Windibank arrives at Baker Street, Holmes informs him that he is aware of his deceptive ways, and despite Windibank committing no crime, Holmes still impends to punish him for his immoral conduct towards his stepdaughter.</div><div><br></div><div>Windibank frantically leaves Baker Street, but Holmes assures Watson that he expects that Windibank to embark on a criminal journey. Holmes also decides not to tell Mary Sutherland about what he has discovered, believing, that his client will not believe him anyway.</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><p></p></div>
