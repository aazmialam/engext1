            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-4">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s highly distinctive character, Sherlock Holmes, is almost universally known for his excellence in identifying and capturing criminals in his understated and uniquely downplayed manner. Both critics Mae Leigh Cooke and Stanton O. Berg explore the idea of Holmes’ construction and origins within their work - Fear of and Fascination with the Foreign in Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes Adventures and Sherlock Holmes: Father of Scientific Crime and Detection, respectively, to give the reader an exposition around the contextual background from which he springs, and the elements of his character that serve to provide models for criminology and forensics that are still relevant today. Through the analysis of these two critiques, we can get a better idea of some of the contextual and thematic ideas that permeate the stories, stories which by Doyle’s account, were often created as an idle pastime and in an unplanned and spur of the moment manner (Cooke).<p></p><p></p><div><br></div><div>Mae Leigh Cooke’s essay Fear of and Fascination with the Foreign in Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes Adventures (July 2010) is focused on the ways in which Doyle crafted the complexities of Sherlock Holmes’ character within context that held both a sense of fear and fascination towards the foreign cultures that composed part of the British Empire at this time, a time when interactions with such cultures produced as sense of both wonder and repulsion, fascination and fear. Cooke outlines the manner by which Doyle often created his stories, often in a casual way, highlighting a moment when he knocked off an entire story during a break for tea during a game of cricket. This tells us that for Doyle these constructions were not so much deliberately created, but rather came to him in a spur of the moment manner, and therefore it can be argued that in this unself-conscious manner of their construction, the character of the zeitgeist came to be less artfully and more transparently reflected in his stories. In that sense then, Doyle was reflecting the cultural zeitgeist, with its fears and prejudices, but also fascination and pride. Cooke also makes the interesting point that the fear of the foreign as well as a sense of superiority was validated by the science of the times, which saw such civilisations as less developed and therefore as inferior. Cooke points out that the overwhelming representation of the other, the foreign, in Doyle is in some way irredeemably incompatible with British culture and sensibility. The frequent casting of the foreign as the criminal element in the stories is not surprising for the time period, given the juxtaposition of moral value systems, but Cooke also points out that Doyle often teases his audience, by precisely assigning the criminal role not to the foreigner but to the ill-educated, the immoral, and the lower class. Occasionally the foreign character is the sympathetic one, or at least, as a neutral and scientifically objective representative of their particular race, to be treated with respect on that basis alone. But Doyle played with his contemporary reader’s prejudices and often makes instead someone else be the guilty party, so that the foreign character becomes a false lead.</div><div><br></div><div>Cooke also brings attention to the fascination during Doyle’s period with drugs such as cocaine and opium, which had been imported into Britain as part of the lucrative trading that was occurring across the Empire, and was being processed perfectly legally into a variety of products for general purchase by the end of the nineteenth century such as lotions and medications. Indeed, Holmes is depicted as a cocaine addict without any reprobation on the part of Watson’s narrative voice, only as part of an observation that this is not uncommon and part of the times. Thus, the study examines the cross-cultural exchange that occurred at this time, which led to the legal importation of highly addictive drugs from other parts of the Empire, and the effect that this had on the culture of Britain at this time, of which Holmes becomes a reflection.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The way that science was venerated and esteemed during this period and the uses towards which it is put by Holmes as the one pre-eminent discourse of reality, is central to Stanton O. Berg’s article Sherlock Holmes: Father of Scientific Crime and Detection (1971), which focuses on Holmes’ methodology and discusses the importance of forensics in the process of solving investigations. The author illustrates that the use of evidence was only at a primitive stage at the end of the nineteenth century and this approach to solving a criminal case was not particularly well known nor well utilised. For example, the French criminologist Alphonse Bertillon (1883-1914) adopted many ideas from Holmes’ stories, including the use of Mugg shots, and brought to criminology the idea of rigorous forensic science which is a central part of Holmes’ methods. The article outlines a number of extensive examples of such approaches, highlighting how Doyle has been highly influential in the real world of policing and forensic investigations. Berg enhances his credibility as an author by citing a number of professionals working in areas of criminology such as Ashton Wolfe who puts forward procedural methods used by the police for solving crimes in a forensic and scientific manner, that have been influenced by Doyle’s stories. The article also raises a common misconception that Doyle borrowed the scientific methodology from Austrian magistrate Hans Gross, whose Handbook for Examining Magistrates didn’t get published until 1893, the time when Doyle was writing The Final Problem, in which Holmes is killed off (he was later resurrected by Doyle for more stories.) Berg argues that the German linguist Ernst Sittig was influenced by Holmes’ ability to decipher ciphered texts, in applying the same scientific approach that Holmes does. Overall, Berg makes his argument that Doyle has been enormously influential in many areas of criminology, and more surprisingly, that such innovations that he invented, were entirely from Doyle’s own ‘fertile imagination’.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, both texts address the ways in which Holmes’ character was crafted, with Cooke drawing attention to the extent to which Doyle (consciously or unconsciously) drew from the times, and Berg highlighting how Doyle was a major innovator in scientific forensics through the power of his imagination alone.</div><div><br></div></div>
