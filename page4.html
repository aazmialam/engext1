This often leads to strong materialistic desire which result in the formation an immoral character. Good morning 11G1. Today I will be addressing the cultural concerns explored within both A Case of Identity by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and its appropriation Deadly Dating.</p><p>A Case of Identity is based on the story of Miss Mary Sutherland who unknowingly suffers an experience of falling in love with her own step father disguised as her lover. He attempts to pursue her to succeed in satisfying his financial greed for wealth. Similarly, Deadly Dating is centralised on the life of a woman who meets her disguised step father who later becomes her husband, Hosmer, on an online dating site only to be murdered by him.&nbsp;</p><p>A Case of Identity focuses on the ways in which disguise can be used to manipulate and take advantage of human naivety. Disguise is the driving force behind the formation of the detective fiction era, in which individuals face an identity crisis. Doyle highlights the powers of physical disguise, “he [Hosmer] disguised himself, [in] tinted glasses and a pair of bushy whiskers” allows him to capitalise the innocence of Mary Sutherland.  However, the story also highlights the inability of disguise to be sustained, “but the deception could not be kept up forever.”&nbsp;</p><p>Deadly Dating, transposes the idea of disguise to the realm of online dating, where Windibank has similar motivations to marry Mary for her money and then dispose of her, but uses contemporary means of social media to do so. Windibank is presented as cynical and cruel during the arrest sequence, “come on copper, come and arrest me.” In this way, the reader has a clear idea that he has little regard for human life, even his own. Overall, a disguised character allows for the development of a mysterious plotline.</p><p>The sense of morality of A Case of Identity is established by the characterisation of the murderer himself, Mr Windibank. His strong immoral character results in his irrational decisions to be more financially powerful was his main drive throughout the story which explains his actions towards Mary, “the man married a woman very much older than himself for her money, and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them”. This shows the corrupting effects of the money on the human mind and the drastic ways in which it may cause detriment. To bring the situation to justice, Holmes concludes, that “there never was a man who deserved punishment more”.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, Deadly Dating, demonstrates that despite the time differences, human exploitation is still sustained through the ages. This is evident through the characterisation of Windibank’s demise, “[as he stayed married to her] for six months to ensure that he would be able to pocket Mary’s life insurance money.” This confirms that questions about human morality still remain, and these are dealt with in the story form.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, aspects of human nature such as disguise and immorality are values that are maintained through generations, which is conveyed through Doyle’s storytelling.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p></div>
